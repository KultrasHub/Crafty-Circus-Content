I could stay calm and cool-headed in most situations and do not really pay attention on what people think of me. However, I am always a curious boy, I often fantasize about living in a sci-fi worlds and visual worlds. I love watching movies of the fantasy future and hold the desire of creating my own imaginary world where people enjoy. I have a great enthusiasm and interest in space and cartoon, for that, I am extremely into sci-fi tales from movies or books. Additionally, I consider myself a crafty person, as a child, I made dragons, soliders out of paper because it fulfilled my desire. However, papercrafting seems a bit off for a 18 years old boy so I changed to game development. To be honest, I love making video games, when I first started it with unity I realised what my purpose is. I have over twenty projects, though the majority of them is abandoned, I completed some. Then I received many compliments of the games but I have not consider it a success. Therefore, I will still follow this path to the end.";

My student ID is just after this 2 dots mark: S3863969. Sharing a little bit about myself, I like made rap, mixed beat, and of course sport is on the list too especially badminton. The story of how I get my attention in IT was started from a movie named “Mission Impossible” and a person in that movie name Benji Dunn was inspired me a lot since then I started to learn more about the world of technology and virtual numbers. I also have many good experiences in IT especially programming software and web-design (I study full-stack so front-end and back-end are both my fields). After all that time of experiencing and updating knowledge about this field, I learned that the world and people are only gorillas without technology. That's a bit of information about myself. This is Kent from the Crafty Circus team with hip hop and love.";

He is like my idol and , therefore, I have been always wanted to have a nose like him. It is sooooo Flexible =^= but mostly because I dont have one which is weird for a clown :/ . By the way, I also have a huge adoration for IT because, I am virtual. So my plan on IT is to discover the way to be real, I want to exist out there T^T because I am drown in boredom already, you know being a statue is a mundane hobby. Life out there is so interesting and exciting, I want to see snow because, Olaf is made of snow and I might find him. So I am one hundred percent ready to learn IT. By the way, try not to look at me much, it's human nature to be uncomfortable when being looked.";

I am lazy whenever nothing can interest me to do but as soon as I like it, I spend all the time for it, days and nights. I like playing badminton and soccer, but I do not have time and partners to play with, I can be in any group and type of people. There is a long story for me about absolutely studying Information Technology. Since I was in grade 11th, I wished that someday I could create something innovative just like Apple or Microsoft. First it was a dream, then my brother said that IT is one of the most difficult majors in which students graduate very few. At that moment, I was scared, I listened to my parents apply into Hospitality in RMIT. Right there, after two semesters studying, I had found myself getting bored because of business. I found Daniel Shiffman channel who teaches JS, HTML, CSS, ect,.. I admired him and started learning code from him and Processing was the first application which I wrote down my first code. Now, I am going to be a Junior then further due to learning all courses in RMIT. I am wondering if RMIT or me or could be both will help me to be good at using code to help people. ";

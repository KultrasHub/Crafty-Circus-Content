            Tran Nguyen Anh Khoa <br> ID: S3863956 <br> <br> Born and raised in a tranquill city, Dalat, I don't usually lose my temper. I could stay calm and cool-headed in most situations and do not really pay attention on what people think of me.
            However, I am always a curious boy, I often fantasize about living in a sci-fi worlds and visual worlds. I love watching movies of the fantasy future and hold the desire of creating my own imaginary world where people enjoy. I have a
            great enthusiasm and interest in space and cartoon, for that, I am extremely into sci-fi tales from movies or books. Additionally, I consider myself a crafty person, as a child, I made dragons, soliders out of paper because it fulfilled
            my desire. However, papercrafting seems a bit off for a 18 years old boy so I changed to game development. To be honest, I love making video games, when I first started it with unity I realised what my purpose is. I have over twenty
            projects, though the majority of them is abandoned, I completed some. Then I received many compliments of the games but I have not consider it a success. Therefore, I will still follow this path to the end.

        In Assignment 2, there was a huge procrastination in our group for the few first week, teammates did not complete the content on time. This resulted in extremely exhausting work for the time before deadline. Though we were able to finish the
        assignment on
        time, however, we do not want to spend an enormous burst of energy in a short time. Therefore, we came up with a plan of having punishment for late individual work. We believe members in Crafty Circus will be more responsible in this
        assignment.

              Our first project is going to be a game. Our team will create a game to let maximum 4 people to join and have fun while they are playing with each other. Those four players will play online, thus, many people in the world can have a
              chance to play together. In the game, our team will create many maps in order to let the players choose whatever they want to play with their friends or they can choose it randomly. However, there will also be a story mode for those who
              want to play games with a little plot. In the game, there will be many kinds of enemies going on the path to destroy your place. The players are supposed to put their weapons in some place to destroy the enemies, these weapons are able
              to change the position later.
            </p><br>
            <br>
            <p>Since our team came up with an idea that we would make our first game. We hope that people who spend time playing our game will have lots of different kinds of feelings, which are fun, angry, hopeful, hopeless, etc…. Because we want
              the players to spend time challenging themselves to get the game finished with many different strategies and get high scores. We hope that people who play this game will be able to make friends even they can not have a chance to meet
              each other.

        We want to create an environment for everyone to have a chance to connect. That is the reason why we believe that The Game will be interesting enough for everyone. Moreover, nowadays, everyone tends to play games online and play with friends
        more than games offline and play alone. Moreover, we create this game for everyone which means streamers also can play it, meaning that we can help them to find a new game to interact with viewers. Fortunately, if we are able to make this
        project, we are able to show new members, if we recruit, which we can motivate them that we can make a new one like this in the future and we also can develop this game in 3D to attract more players.

        In the market, there are a lot of games which are similar to The Game, for example Tower Defense King, Tower Defence Fantasy, Tower Defense Zone. These games are played by using the game's currency to buy weapons and place them on the way.
        Those games are extremely addictive because more than 5 million downloads for each, they also have the rate over 4 stars. However, those three are differently compared to our project, The Game. Because our game is supposed to be played by a
        group of four people to win the game. Moreover, the weapons in our game are allowed to bring it to another place. We also have maps to be chosen to play randomly to interest players in any map they want. That is the biggest difference between
        ours and others. In case that players who play our game do not have partners, they are able to play the story mode or play with bots.

            <h1>AIM & GOALS</h1>
            <p>
              Our team has decided to make a game as our project because we would like to concentrate on how we bring entertainment to life and create memorable moments for players. Therefore, in order to reach our aim, our team is going to reach as
              small as goals first. We want people to have fun, to investigate and examine the concept we bring. The game will have 6 on 8 features of fun, based on collected game design roads. This includes Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship,
              Discovery and Submission. The way players control mythical heroes or explore unknown place is undoable in real life and here is where the game is fun. It is due to the fact that they will experience things they never had before.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              First of all, our game focuses on helping people to connect. This means that everyone is able to download it and play it together while they are hanging out or even they can have fun while they are staying at home. Since The Game is
              able to play online and allow maximum 4 people to play, every player can make friends worldwide. Especially to local-area players, when friends, brothers, family play with each other, they are developing their relationship.

              <br>The Game would like to force everyone to always come up with new ideas in order to pass the game. Particularly, each map of the game will not be hard but more challenging for players. In order to let the players feel they are
              smarter and more satisfied as soon as they have strategies that work. In this way they are able to compare with our team who has already finished the map before to show that there is not a way to make it.
              <br>Another goal we wanted to have in the game is compelling story. It is the story that made characters unique as they should have differentiate background, and appearance. This would add to the overall enjoyment of the game as players
              may feel connected to their loved characters.
              <br>At the start of every match, players begin with few supply and they will have to get income from low-level minions which sounds a bit boring. However, in reality, low-level farming is not mundane at all, many players enjoy
              destroying and feeling unstoppable which weak minions is suitable.

      <p>Plan & Process</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Content">
      <p>Onto the main section, the plans and progress. Since the time we were doing our assignment 2 on the project section our group members had already decided and outlined our project for future usage. Since the four of us share one common thing
        is that we enjoy playing games and program coding, so we simply combined the mutual interests together and code ourselves a game that we desire. That was the easy part of the process, the first small-but-not-so-small challenge we went against
        was choosing what type of game we will be creating. Because throughout the history of gaming development, the game developers have come up with so many types of games consisting of unique gameplay styles to be able to satisfy multiple groups
        of users all around the world and not just simply target one crowd of players, such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games that are designed for players that are into a competitive team fighting style games such as League of Legends,
        Dota, or if fighting games if players are into a one-on-one showdown where you can beat your opponent with your creative optimal combos and amazing reflexes. Going back to our game choosing problem, after taking consideration looking at each
        members’ skills and experiences we have listed out the limitations our first game should have to make it so that it is relatively easy to make and the players would still enjoy playing the game, and that is when we as a group has decided to
        make a tower defense game.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The reason behind a tower defense game is that, gameplay wise, the basic mechanics that the creators need to pay attention to is the movement behaviour of each unit inside the game, the terrain and the ability to design levels so that the
        game can gradually become more challenging and encourage the players to think outside of the box, that was the generic features for every tower defense game out there, to add in our different unique approach onto the game we will be putting
        the players into the map and instead of just dragging a turret onto the desired location, the turrets and items will be randomly dropped onto the map and the players will have to manually move their character to the drop location and pick
        them up before placing them down to deal with the enemy waves. By modifying the mechanics we are giving the players more option than just drag and drop, now not only that they have to think about where to place down their defense, but they
        will have to think about what is the best way to optimize the time between travelling to the drop zone and placing down the turrets in the ideal space there will be more features added into the game to increase the quality of life for
        players, that is basically our game plan design for the group project.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>As of this moment our group has already developed the story line for the game as well as the description of in-game items, our way of approaching the game first is going for the content description as it is a written part of the project that
        can be completed right away without encountering any challenges. As this segment is being written the group has already finished designing one of the stage maps of the game for the use of demonstration, Khoa, the core member of our group, the
        one that is helping the group making the project real is currently showing the group his ways around the Unity platform while teaching the members how to make the overall map. Not only that but the website introducing the project is already
        reaching its final stage including the background, designing and details, overall concepts of how the game is going to be. Knowing all four of us do not have enough experience to create a game yet so all of us are approaching the project step
        by step slowly. Currently, we are giving our best and focus on completing the website, its present version still lacks proper context distribution, most of the problems surrounding how to put in a large amount of information into a segment
        without it looking boring towards the viewers’ eyes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Here is our plan in detail, initially we will have our workforce into 2 categories, Khoa and Nhat will be working on graphics and ideas while Phong and Kent will do the coding part. Khoa with his artistic talent will work on creating
        characters, and Nhat will search for free game asset to minimize our budget and time, Nhat is also responsible for building map. The programmer team will set up basic movement and interaction with turrets.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In the second stage of the work, Khoa will be doing more on sketching, and we will have more concept of enemy minions, as we want to have a good diversity. Nhat will be on the programming team at this stage, specifically, Kent, Phong and
        Nhat will use a navigation map to define which is walkable and an unwalkable area to enemies. Moreover, they will build different behaviors for each type of enemy based on our discussion. This includes movement, attacking, immobilized stage,
        taken damage, buff and debuff. With uncompleted art, programmers in our team will be working with white squares.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In the next stage, after finishing sketching, Khoa will blow life to those sketches by adding color and retexturing the outlines. Shadow is also added to create depth for ingame characters. On the other hand, the programming team will build
        behaviors for turrets. It is likely we will have another discussion on this to have the right aim toward this stage. What we expect in turrets is that they must be balanced and possess a certain power and weakness. This enables players to
        play with diverse strategies, adding fun and challenges to the game. Overtune or underpower turrets will be modified at testing. At the end of this stage the game is fundamentally playable.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The next work that we will put on line is having visual effect and sound effect for interactions, therefore, Khoa and Kent will be occupied with the artistic work. Khoa will continue working on the graphic while Kent will undertake the audio
        section. With the playable game, we will have some testing, which we will be searching for errors and unwanted features. This stage, in a nutshell, we will perfect our game play. It is also considerable to have a survey for any possible
        improvement and modification.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>At the end of the previous stage, we are likely to have a perfect game play in a single scene, yet we will need some indicators such as UI. This is also when we will be about to build a system of saving and loading. This system will enable
        later developments for example, character selection, skin selection, currency transportation between scenes.Additionally The programmer team will be assigned to both building systems and UI. Due to a smaller amount of work on UI graphic and
        sound, both Kent and Khoa will also do program tasks.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Ultimately, the game will be almost completed, the next part is that we will construct a menu, starting scene and other maps. During this stage, Kent will be assigned with background music composition. He will undertake plenty of work in
        this part as he is responsible for background music in the menu, different maps with different environments and when the battle boss appears. Other members will be working on level design, where we anticipate another discussion. We believe
        that level designing plays an important role in influencing as well as delivering an impact towards our video game. According to our plan, the game is designed for collaboration, as a result, every map needs to express this attribute.
        Advancing into the main scene, we would build a shop where players purchase and unlock new characters, equipment and items. There would also be many other facilities inside the main scene too, map selection, character selection, smith for
        upgrading, an indicating banner that shows your current rankings across the leaderboard, where top players are honored and events. There is also a consideration among us of making a ranking system, to illustrate, this system title all players
        with appellations, and at the end of the year they will be rewarded with the rank they earn. It seems to add more challenge but still more work on our team. The game should be complete at this stage.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>We will hold the lasting meeting which we will discuss about monetization. According to our research, players prefer reward-video rather than any other kind of advertisement. Therefore, we would build this rewarding system based on the
        length of the advertisement. We prefer Unity ads over Google ads ,as a result we would only use Google ads as a substitution in case Unity ads does not work. The reason behind this is Unity ads are about other games in which may have a
        gameplay ads, this type of ads allows players to fill their time rather than just watching. A consequence of this is that players would not get bored with ads and continue on watching at least to meet their reward demands. We also have some
        analysis about banners ads and we found an effective solution to maximize our income. It is due to the fact that when the game is paused by menus, there is an unused large space, and players only pay attention to the menu. We would take
        advantage of this harmless space for banner ads. Finally, it is also necessary for In App Purchase(IAP), which according to statistics, accounts for 20% of overall revenue of many video games, it may help players to process the video game
        faster. They would experience the game fulfiller.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>There were moments when our design did not work as planned, situations like the website refused to pop up a short demo video consisting the images of the initial character, turret sketch designs that we wanted instead it did not pop up at
        all so we had to discuss about if we want to reconsider to remove that video option and we have decided to change it into one of the website’s gallery banner. A couple of times when we looked back at some of the game’s assets and backtracked
        thinking whether or not if those extra elements can potentially bring down the level of interest of the gameplay overall, initially there will be a pet system that can assist the players with scouting and getting the dropped items for them,
        not only that but there was going to be a friendship system that increases over the amount of times players bring their pets along with them onto the battleground, but with all of the work that has already weighing down onto the member’s
        to-do list, the whole crew started to lose motivation, so in order to minimize the amount of work, we decided that all of the details we thought are unnecessary will be removed and refocus making the gameplay to reduce the dilution bringing
        back the original tower defense atmosphere. Though it is something that the group still wants to revisit the moment the game is fully designed and attempts to implement the features in as an update patch, in the future the pet system can
        surely improve the players’ quality of life. But until then, it is highly recommended that our group needs to accomplish developing the game first.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In addition there will be multiple kinds of turrets that shoot multiple types of bullets with different travel speeds, Khoa had an idea of designing the curve projectile of each of the turret’s bullets, although it may seems to add more
        realistic towards the game but to know how to code it out it will have to take one person a lot of time to learn the physic behind the curvings, moreover they would have to deliver that concept into codes for the game which would consume a
        huge amount of our time. To our response we discussed and drew out the conclusion of aborting the idea of curving missiles/bullets. Same goes for the pet system, curve projectiles will be one of the future changes of the game. Judging from
        the roadblocks that we have encountered during the time working on the project the ones that we made changes to were mostly because of how much time it consumes rather than we getting ourselves into technical troubleshootings. Technical-wise
        there were problems and issues that our group had come across but they did not make that much of an obstacle for us to classify them as deadends mainly because at the end of the day we would always find a way to interact with the problem
        instead of choosing our way to remove it.

      At the beginning of the project idea, the game was inspired from a smaller video game from Game Jam. To be clear, Game Jam is a contest where participants create games from scratch within a small period of time. This means that we have already
      considered the feasibility of the making as we did not take a serious project. However, it is not without any consideration, according to our plan, this tower defense game would be available to both multiplayer mode and single player mode. As
      our research shows, Unity would support an online server with upto 20 players. This led us to some hesitations, also a limitation, that the game will not support online-player mode at first. As a result, our scope was to create a game that only
      enables multiplayers in local areas when their devices are connected. This will allow us to investigate further to see if the game would receive much attention or not and from this foundation, the game could jump into an online server or not.
      <br> <br>
      Unity Pro is also expensive for our group. Though it is mostly acceptable as we have no need for the Pro version, we are not happy to have Unity logo on startup of the game. Therefore, we mark this as another disadvantage.
      <br> <br>
      Another issue bothering us is level design, as we mentioned earlier in the description, the game heavily relies on collaboration. This develops some restrictions in level design, because we can reuse maps for single player for multiplayers.
      Eventually, this could be a huge limitation that we may not provide a good diversity for the game. The way we could look deeper into the solution may be to allow players to build maps and with high ratings, we could buy the map with reward for
      those players. This scope may be problematic, we think players may abuse this method to get reward.

        Our project is to create a game and our team would like to make sure that it will absolutely be played with the least errors possible, therefore, it is compulsory to get The Game tested frequently until it is finished and run smoothly.
        Particularly, we are going to test the gameplay if it crashes while playing before adding graphics, characters, animations and music. Then, the animations need to be accurate and consistent. Our project needs to have a demo firstly for users
        who will give us feedback if there are any mistakes or gibberish. Users are those who have intermediate knowledge about each part of our game because they can help to improve our game to be better. Moreover, users can be a group of people
        whom we randomly choose in RMIT. Although they will not look at details like the intermediate ones, they will have recognized what is wrong happening to our game and if they understand the content of our game or not. Furthermore, they give us
        their feelings about The Game and what they would like to have in the game as a player. Therefore, the intermediate ones can be lecturers in the school and the “player” one that we can ask some random students in the school to play the demo.
        Our expectation is around 20 testers, half IT-professional and half not.

    <h1>RISK</h1>
    <p>Since our group focuses towards making a phone game and more than half of our members have not made any game before, elements like getting used to using the supporting software will be the most difficult challenge. Tools like Unity, Visual
      Studio, Spine, 2D Animation package, etc… None of the group members has experienced using them before, and we do not know how difficult they are to handle and to be able to maximize the features that are given to us, this is by far one of the
      major risks that our group will be encountering . Aside from tool difficulties, coding will also be taking part to the project’s uncertainties, there are specific coding languages that programming games would preferred to be working with and
      that means our group member have to learn to code using that language, that would potentially lead to a huge amount of time loss from getting to know the language and trying to figuring out how to solve the code errors

    <p class="SingleContent">
      The group members are aware that being able to communicate with each other during our time working together takes a very big role in order to produce our desired results. And by taking a look at each members’ location we have determined that
      the best way to correspond to each group member would be through texting in a group chat and calling through an online chat app called Discord. The meeting will be hosted twice a week during our working time, occasionally there will be three or
      more based on the progress of our group members and the time we have left before presenting the project. As for texting in the group chat, everyone will be keeping each other up to date with their progress daily to keep track and tackle the
      situation right away if there are any surprise problems that pop up. Aside from meeting each other online, after lectures and during tutorials we can also discuss the current state of the project on campus. If there are any situations that
      prevent one of the group members from the weekly group meeting such as problems in their local area, each members are responsible for informing the rest of the group members about it, we would always ask the members about their free time to
      come up with a meeting period that everyone’s able to participate so the probability of someone not attending the meeting will not be high. And if there are decisions that have to be made during the meeting and one of the members are not
      present, the rest of the group will have to decide for them and inform them on the group chat, and will further assist them if there is something that they do not understand. We put a lot of effort into each of our meetings to provide enough
      information so that each member will have more time to focus on their work.

          We could see many improvements in our team this assignment, most partial tasks are punctual. This develops from the fact that the teammates take more serious responsibility than assignment 2 and they also pay more attention and response to my call. Therefore, overall, I feel happy when working with my team. Compared to the last assignment, we have a more professional-looking website this time, which makes me feel confident of our ability. Another positive change we also made is that work distribution is better divided, we did not have any member that overworks or underworks. I may be the one who has to do more work than them, however, I think it is completely acceptable as one reason is that I am the leader and secondly I am the one who has experience in the video game industry. So  it is my duty to give them support. This really helps me a lot because I now have more certainty to be a future leader.
<br><br>
          On the other hand, there are still many issues that I am not satisfied with. Firstly, Kent was extremely careless in his writing and reading questions. This results in some unwanted delay. The second issue is the amount of work this time was heavier than before as we have to do both assignments 2 and presentation, moreover, the first week of the assignment 3 was taken to fill the assignment 2 and we also had a test in the next week which resulted in our late start.

          In this Assignment 3, it can be said that there have been many improvements compared to the previous Assignment. All plans were proposed, and the parts of this project were assigned to the members more appropriately and logically. All team members this time are responsible and coordinated better, especially everyone is very adhering to the progress set out try hard to complete it. However, there are still things that need to be improved. Communication is improved, but it still not good enough. Besides this time in Assignment, unexpected incidents caused the members to have to correct it many times, although this is not a big obstacle. The only surprising thing that the team members did not expect is that the content this time is much harder than the previous time it is like a real business project, which has caused a bit of difficulty for the team.

          Throughout this assignment I can proudly say that I have given my best towards this assignment, I have turned in my part on time, spend more of my time on assisting Kultras and Kent on their side no matter how big or small their request was, I can finally see my own improvements towards my last flaws in the last assignment which was being late on submitting my sections and not managing my time well while I do my work. I have learned and drew out my solutions from my experience by making myself a physical to-do list and cut a bit of time from each of my daily routines and invest them into my working time which then produce out the best version of my contents and I do not have to stay up late doing my work in an unhealthy non-productive way. Even though base on the git commit flow chart I am the member that has the least commits for the first couples of weeks, that is because every time I commit something I always commit most of my work in, within those commits it will show how much content that I have put in per commit to make up for the low commissions. The one thing that I have learned from working in a group is that communication is the key to success, every time we host a meet up, even if someone in the group have not finished with their work yet, it is our best interest that we need to be informed about that so that we can assign the members that have already finished with their part to help out.

          In my own perception, each member in the group is responsible and gets their tasks done as soon as possible even though there was sometimes that each of us was busy. We read each other's tasks to improve and make sure that we are doing
          right, this is the best thing while we are doing in that group because it shows how responsible we are for the assignment, not only the single task we have been given. One thing that I think we are doing better than the previous assignment
          is that we are getting used to using Github. Due to the number of commits in Github, We are now using Github frequently, we do not wait until we have the task done and then commit at the end. This is the good thing that we are now able to
          keep track of everyone's tasks guaranteedly, because it has evidence which is more reliable than just reporting by talking. Surprisingly, this assignment has not had a long deadline, it is more or less short, however, our team is able to
          manage and get it done sooner than the previous one. This is a good point while we are in a team which shows how improved we are.

          Evaluating the overall assignment progression of the group, one thing that is for sure went very well is the punctuation of all of the group members, though it has shown an average improvement comparing to the previous assignment but it sure helped the group to review back on the contents that they did and the group were able to add in some extra fancy details towards the website and develop more on some of the important parts of the sections. The things that could be improved are focused on the individual performance, there were times that Kent did not execute his assigned section correctly and delivered the wrong context in which we noticed and quickly notify him to redo his section, because of that the group extended the date to another two days so that he can get back to speed with the rest, group members, he did receive assistance from the group members but the group only provides him enough information to guide his thinking towards the correct way to encourage his critical thinking skills instead of telling him where or do this, do that. From our last assignment working together there were not a lot of communication nor interaction between most of the group mates and the requirements of the last assignment was lesser comparing to the current assignment so everyone expected that on this assignment there will be more strugglings with the exchanging group information and assignment progression, but when we jumped into the work we were surprised that the level of communication and participation of every group members has improved so much since the last group work, everyone synergizes well and the group manages to progress within the desired speed process. Evaluating the group’s github log of activity it is safe to say that the group members’ commission frequency are equally distributed throughout the weeks, though Phong’s commission may seems to be a bit underwhelming comparing to the other group members but that is because he tends to focus on completing all of the section first before committing them onto the web and each of his commissions he puts a chunk of content onto the website which results in the low commissions for couples of the early weeks. Other than that everyone is absolutely giving their best effort into this assignment, individually and as teammates, and we are certain that our collaboration skills will be improved much further if we continue to work together as a group after this assignment.

            Tran Nguyen Anh Khoa <br> ID: S3863956 <br> <br> Born and raised in a tranquill city, Dalat, I don't usually lose my temper. I could stay calm and cool-headed in most situations and do not really pay attention on what people think of me.
            However, I am always a curious boy, I often fantasize about living in a sci-fi worlds and visual worlds. I love watching movies of the fantasy future and hold the desire of creating my own imaginary world where people enjoy. I have a
            great enthusiasm and interest in space and cartoon, for that, I am extremely into sci-fi tales from movies or books. Additionally, I consider myself a crafty person, as a child, I made dragons, soliders out of paper because it fulfilled
            my desire. However, papercrafting seems a bit off for a 18 years old boy so I changed to game development. To be honest, I love making video games, when I first started it with unity I realised what my purpose is. I have over twenty
            projects, though the majority of them is abandoned, I completed some. Then I received many compliments of the games but I have not consider it a success. Therefore, I will still follow this path to the end.

        In Assignment 2, there was a huge procrastination in our group for the few first week, teammates did not complete the content on time. This resulted in extremely exhausting work for the time before deadline. Though we were able to finish the
        assignment on
        time, however, we do not want to spend an enormous burst of energy in a short time. Therefore, we came up with a plan of having punishment for late individual work. We believe members in Crafty Circus will be more responsible in this
        assignment.

However, Khoa is fond of a design position while developing a game. Design and programming are completely different, design is harder than programming in my opinion. Because it needs to be creative and attractive, which is the face of the product, in this case, it is the face of our game.

              Our first project is going to be a game. Our team will create a game to let maximum 4 people to join and have fun while they are playing with each other. Those four players will play online, thus, many people in the world can have a
              chance to play together. In the game, our team will create many maps in order to let the players choose whatever they want to play with their friends or they can choose it randomly. However, there will also be a story mode for those who
              want to play games with a little plot. In the game, there will be many kinds of enemies going on the path to destroy your place. The players are supposed to put their weapons in some place to destroy the enemies, these weapons are able
              to change the position later.
            </p><br>
            <br>
            <p>Since our team came up with an idea that we would make our first game. We hope that people who spend time playing our game will have lots of different kinds of feelings, which are fun, angry, hopeful, hopeless, etc…. Because we want
              the players to spend time challenging themselves to get the game finished with many different strategies and get high scores. We hope that people who play this game will be able to make friends even they can not have a chance to meet
              each other.

        We want to create an environment for everyone to have a chance to connect. That is the reason why we believe that The Game will be interesting enough for everyone. Moreover, nowadays, everyone tends to play games online and play with friends more than games offline and play alone. Moreover, we create this game for everyone which means streamers also can play it, meaning that we can help them to find a new game to interact with viewers. Fortunately, if we are able to make this project, we are able to show new members, if we recruit, which we can motivate them that we can make a new one like this in the future and we also can develop this game in 3D to attract more players.

        In the market, there are a lot of games which are similar to The Game, for example Tower Defense King, Tower Defence Fantasy, Tower Defense Zone. These games are played by using the game's currency to buy weapons and place them on the way. Those games are extremely addictive because more than 5 million downloads for each, they also have the rate over 4 stars. However, those three are differently compared to our project, The Game. Because our game is supposed to be played by a group of four people to win the game. Moreover, the weapons in our game are allowed to bring it to another place. We also have maps to be chosen to play randomly to interest players in any map they want. That is the biggest difference between ours and others. In case that players who play our game do not have partners, they are able to play the story mode or play with bots.

            <h1>AIM & GOALS</h1>
            <p>
              Our team has decided to make a game as our project because we would like to concentrate on how we bring entertainment to life and create memorable moments for players. Therefore, in order to reach our aim, our team is going to reach as
              small as goals first. We want people to have fun, to investigate and examine the concept we bring. The game will have 6 on 8 features of fun, based on collected game design roads. This includes Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship,
              Discovery and Submission. The way players control mythical heroes or explore unknown place is undoable in real life and here is where the game is fun. It is due to the fact that they will experience things they never had before.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              First of all, our game focuses on helping people to connect. This means that everyone is able to download it and play it together while they are hanging out or even they can have fun while they are staying at home. Since The Game is
              able to play online and allow maximum 4 people to play, every player can make friends worldwide. Especially to local-area players, when friends, brothers, family play with each other, they are developing their relationship.

              <br>The Game would like to force everyone to always come up with new ideas in order to pass the game. Particularly, each map of the game will not be hard but more challenging for players. In order to let the players feel they are
              smarter and more satisfied as soon as they have strategies that work. In this way they are able to compare with our team who has already finished the map before to show that there is not a way to make it.
              <br>Another goal we wanted to have in the game is compelling story. It is the story that made characters unique as they should have differentiate background, and appearance. This would add to the overall enjoyment of the game as players
              may feel connected to their loved characters.
              <br>At the start of every match, players begin with few supply and they will have to get income from low-level minions which sounds a bit boring. However, in reality, low-level farming is not mundane at all, many players enjoy
              destroying and feeling unstoppable which weak minions is suitable.

      <p>Plan & Process</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Content">
      <p>Onto the main section, the plans and progress. Since the time we were doing our assignment 2 on the project section our group members had already decided and outlined our project for future usage. Since the four of us share one common thing is that we enjoy playing games and program coding, so we simply combined the mutual interests together and code ourselves a game that we desire. That was the easy part of the process, the first small-but-not-so-small challenge we went against was choosing what type of game we will be creating. Because throughout the history of gaming development, the game developers have come up with so many types of games consisting of unique gameplay styles to be able to satisfy multiple groups of users all around the world and not just simply target one crowd of players, such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games that are designed for players that are into a competitive team fighting style games such as League of Legends, Dota, or if fighting games if players are into a one-on-one showdown where you can beat your opponent with your creative optimal combos and amazing reflexes. Going back to our game choosing problem, after taking consideration looking at each members’ skills and experiences we have listed out the limitations our first game should have to make it so that it is relatively easy to make and the players would still enjoy playing the game, and that is when we as a group has decided to make a tower defense game.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The reason behind a tower defense game is that, gameplay wise, the basic mechanics that the creators need to pay attention to is the movement behaviour of each unit inside the game, the terrain and the ability to design levels so that the game can gradually become more challenging and encourage the players to think outside of the box, that was the generic features for every tower defense game out there, to add in our different unique approach onto the game we will be putting the players into the map and instead of just dragging a turret onto the desired location, the turrets and items will be randomly dropped onto the map and the players will have to manually move their character to the drop location and pick them up before placing them down to deal with the enemy waves. By modifying the mechanics we are giving the players more option than just drag and drop, now not only that they have to think about where to place down their defense, but they will have to think about what is the best way to optimize the time between travelling to the drop zone and placing down the turrets in the ideal space there will be more features added into the game to increase the quality of life for players, that is basically our game plan design for the group project.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>As of this moment our group has already developed the story line for the game as well as the description of in-game items, our way of approaching the game first is going for the content description as it is a written part of the project that can be completed right away without encountering any challenges. As this segment is being written the group has already finished designing one of the stage maps of the game for the use of demonstration, Khoa, the core member of our group, the one that is helping the group making the project real is currently showing the group his ways around the Unity platform while teaching the members how to make the overall map. Not only that but the website introducing the project is already reaching its final stage including the background, designing and details, overall concepts of how the game is going to be. Knowing all four of us do not have enough experience to create a game yet so all of us are approaching the project step by step slowly. Currently, we are giving our best and focus on completing the website, its present version still lacks proper context distribution, most of the problems surrounding how to put in a large amount of information into a segment without it looking boring towards the viewers’ eyes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Here is our plan in detail, initially we will have our workforce into 2 categories, Khoa and Nhat will be working on graphics and ideas while Phong and Kent will do the coding part. Khoa with his artistic talent will work on creating characters, and Nhat will search for free game asset to minimize our budget and time, Nhat is also responsible for building map. The programmer team will set up basic movement and interaction with turrets.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In the second stage of the work, Khoa will be doing more on sketching, and we will have more concept of enemy minions, as we want to have a good diversity. Nhat will be on the programming team at this stage, specifically, Kent, Phong and Nhat will use a navigation map to define which is walkable and an unwalkable area to enemies. Moreover, they will build different behaviors for each type of enemy based on our discussion. This includes movement, attacking, immobilized stage, taken damage, buff and debuff. With uncompleted art, programmers in our team will be working with white squares.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In the next stage, after finishing sketching, Khoa will blow life to those sketches by adding color and retexturing the outlines. Shadow is also added to create depth for ingame characters. On the other hand, the programming team will build behaviors for turrets. It is likely we will have another discussion on this to have the right aim toward this stage. What we expect in turrets is that they must be balanced and possess a certain power and weakness. This enables players to play with diverse strategies, adding fun and challenges to the game. Overtune or underpower turrets will be modified at testing. At the end of this stage the game is fundamentally playable.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>The next work that we will put on line is having visual effect and sound effect for interactions, therefore, Khoa and Kent will be occupied with the artistic work. Khoa will continue working on the graphic while Kent will undertake the audio section. With the playable game, we will have some testing, which we will be searching for errors and unwanted features. This stage, in a nutshell, we will perfect our game play. It is also considerable to have a survey for any possible improvement and modification.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>At the end of the previous stage, we are likely to have a perfect game play in a single scene, yet we will need some indicators such as UI. This is also when we will be about to build a system of saving and loading. This system will enable later developments for example, character selection, skin selection, currency transportation between scenes.Additionally The programmer team will be assigned to both building systems and UI. Due to a smaller amount of work on UI graphic and sound, both Kent and Khoa will also do program tasks.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Ultimately, the game will be almost completed, the next part is that we will construct a menu, starting scene and other maps. During this stage, Kent will be assigned with background music composition. He will undertake plenty of work in this part as he is responsible for background music in the menu, different maps with different environments and when the battle boss appears. Other members will be working on level design, where we anticipate another discussion. We believe that level designing plays an important role in influencing as well as delivering an impact towards our video game. According to our plan, the game is designed for collaboration, as a result, every map needs to express this attribute. Advancing into the main scene, we would build a shop where players purchase and unlock new characters, equipment and items. There would also be many other facilities inside the main scene too, map selection, character selection, smith for upgrading, an indicating banner that shows your current rankings across the leaderboard, where top players are honored and events. There is also a consideration among us of making a ranking system, to illustrate, this system title all players with appellations, and at the end of the year they will be rewarded with the rank they earn. It seems to add more challenge but still more work on our team. The game should be complete at this stage.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>We will hold the lasting meeting which we will discuss about monetization. According to our research, players prefer reward-video rather than any other kind of advertisement. Therefore, we would build this rewarding system based on the length of the advertisement. We prefer Unity ads over Google ads ,as a result we would only use Google ads as a substitution in case Unity ads does not work. The reason behind this is Unity ads are about other games in which may have a gameplay ads, this type of ads allows players to fill their time rather than just watching. A consequence of this is that players would not get bored with ads and continue on watching at least to meet their reward demands. We also have some analysis about banners ads and we found an effective solution to maximize our income. It is due to the fact that when the game is paused by menus, there is an unused large space, and players only pay attention to the menu. We would take advantage of this harmless space for banner ads. Finally, it is also necessary for In App Purchase(IAP), which according to statistics, accounts for 20% of overall revenue of many video games, it may help players to process the video game faster. They would experience the game fulfiller.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>There were moments when our design did not work as planned, situations like the website refused to pop up a short demo video consisting the images of the initial character, turret sketch designs that we wanted instead it did not pop up at all so we had to discuss about if we want to reconsider to remove that video option and we have decided to change it into one of the website’s gallery banner. A couple of times when we looked back at some of the game’s assets and backtracked thinking whether or not if those extra elements can potentially bring down the level of interest of the gameplay overall, initially there will be a pet system that can assist the players with scouting and getting the dropped items for them, not only that but there was going to be a friendship system that increases over the amount of times players bring their pets along with them onto the battleground, but with all of the work that has already weighing down onto the member’s to-do list, the whole crew started to lose motivation, so in order to minimize the amount of work, we decided that all of the details we thought are unnecessary will be removed and refocus making the gameplay to reduce the dilution bringing back the original tower defense atmosphere. Though it is something that the group still wants to revisit the moment the game is fully designed and attempts to implement the features in as an update patch, in the future the pet system can surely improve the players’ quality of life. But until then, it is highly recommended that our group needs to accomplish developing the game first.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In addition there will be multiple kinds of turrets that shoot multiple types of bullets with different travel speeds, Khoa had an idea of designing the curve projectile of each of the turret’s bullets, although it may seems to add more realistic towards the game but to know how to code it out it will have to take one person a lot of time to learn the physic behind the curvings, moreover they would have to deliver that concept into codes for the game which would consume a huge amount of our time. To our response we discussed and drew out the conclusion of aborting the idea of curving missiles/bullets. Same goes for the pet system, curve projectiles will be one of the future changes of the game. Judging from the roadblocks that we have encountered during the time working on the project the ones that we made changes to were mostly because of how much time it consumes rather than we getting ourselves into technical troubleshootings. Technical-wise there were problems and issues that our group had come across but they did not make that much of an obstacle for us to classify them as deadends mainly because at the end of the day we would always find a way to interact with the problem instead of choosing our way to remove it.

        <h1>Khoa</h1>
        <p>Main Role: <role>Graphic Designer- </role>Khoa could make artwork and create characters as well as environment for us. He will be responsible for User Interface graphic and the in game graphic.</p>
        <p>Sub Role: <role>Programmer- </role>Additionally, he has a strong understanding of programming, so having him on programming team is an enormous advantage, he will be carrying the burden of leader because he has experience in creating games
          before. So we believe he could lead us toward glory.</p>

        <h1>Khang</h1>
        <p>Main Role: <role>Sound Designer- </role>Kent has an extremely profound love for music, so we let him challenge himself to the world of creating background music and SFX( sound effect).</p>
        <p>Sub Role: <role>Programmer- </role>Kent similarly has his attention on Programming, therefore, he would be able to develop this skill through the work. He would work as a programmer when there is no task related to sound.</p>

        <h1>Phong</h1>
        <p>Main Role: <role>Lead Programmer</role> Phong would undertake tasks under the programming field, and work as a substitute when other teammates have to work on non-IT professional tasks such as creating graphics or sound. We think he could
          carry this responsibility is due to his willingness. Phong is self-sacrificing and trust worthy and those characteristics are valuable.</p>

        <h1>Nhat</h1>
        <p>Main Role: <role>Manager- </role>Nhat is responsible for our time management and schedule. He learnt about business before so we believe he would perform this task well to maximize the budget and time.</p>
        <p>Sub Role: <role>Programmer Support </role>Our team of programmer is a bit crowded and we also want to have a less stressing task for him. Therefore, we came up with the solution Programmer Support, one reason is that he will be in IT
          professional and he would not carry a real burden of programming.</p>

      At the beginning of the project idea, the game was inspired from a smaller video game from Game Jam. To be clear, Game Jam is a contest where participants create games from scratch within a small period of time. This means that we have already
      considered the feasibility of the making as we did not take a serious project. However, it is not without any consideration, according to our plan, this tower defense game would be available to both multiplayer mode and single player mode. As
      our research shows, Unity would support an online server with upto 20 players. This led us to some hesitations, also a limitation, that the game will not support online-player mode at first. As a result, our scope was to create a game that only
      enables multiplayers in local areas when their devices are connected. This will allow us to investigate further to see if the game would receive much attention or not and from this foundation, the game could jump into an online server or not.
      <br> <br>
      Unity Pro is also expensive for our group. Though it is mostly acceptable as we have no need for the Pro version, we are not happy to have Unity logo on startup of the game. Therefore, we mark this as another disadvantage.
      <br> <br>
      Another issue bothering us is level design, as we mentioned earlier in the description, the game heavily relies on collaboration. This develops some restrictions in level design, because we can reuse maps for single player for multiplayers.
      Eventually, this could be a huge limitation that we may not provide a good diversity for the game. The way we could look deeper into the solution may be to allow players to build maps and with high ratings, we could buy the map with reward for
      those players. This scope may be problematic, we think players may abuse this method to get reward.

          There are both free license and professtional one for this program. Unity is a video game engine, we would use Unity to build the game and design maps. Khoa has experienced this program before and he has a few video games made out of this
          program. He is familiar with making 2D games.
          <br><br>
          We will also add some external package to Unity:
          <br>
          <br>
          Monetization package: This is an additional package which we will add to the game later for income.
          <br>
          2D Animation package & PSD Importer package: we will use animation package for real animation while psd imported enables Unity to read photoshop files.

        Our project is to create a game and our team would like to make sure that it will absolutely be played with the least errors possible, therefore, it is compulsory to get The Game tested frequently until it is finished and run smoothly.
        Particularly, we are going to test the gameplay if it crashes while playing before adding graphics, characters, animations and music. Then, the animations need to be accurate and consistent. Our project needs to have a demo firstly for users
        who will give us feedback if there are any mistakes or gibberish. Users are those who have intermediate knowledge about each part of our game because they can help to improve our game to be better. Moreover, users can be a group of people
        whom we randomly choose in RMIT. Although they will not look at details like the intermediate ones, they will have recognized what is wrong happening to our game and if they understand the content of our game or not. Furthermore, they give us
        their feelings about The Game and what they would like to have in the game as a player. Therefore, the intermediate ones can be lecturers in the school and the “player” one that we can ask some random students in the school to play the demo.
        Our expectation is around 20 testers, half IT-professional and half not.

    <h1>RISK</h1>
    <p>Since our group focuses towards making a phone game and more than half of our members have not made any game before, elements like getting used to using the supporting software will be the most difficult challenge. Tools like Unity, Visual Studio, Spine, 2D Animation package, etc… None of the group members has experienced using them before, and we do not know how difficult they are to handle and to be able to maximize the features that are given to us, this is by far one of the major risks that our group will be encountering . Aside from tool difficulties, coding will also be taking part to the project’s uncertainties, there are specific coding languages that programming games would preferred to be working with and that means our group member have to learn to code using that language, that would potentially lead to a huge amount of time loss from getting to know the language and trying to figuring out how to solve the code errors

        <p>We are on a quest, check this out for a look into our work and occured events</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="SingleContent">
      The group members are aware that being able to communicate with each other during our time working together takes a very big role in order to produce our desired results. And by taking a look at each members’ location we have determined that the best way to correspond to each group member would be through texting in a group chat and calling through an online chat app called Discord. The meeting will be hosted twice a week during our working time, occasionally there will be three or more based on the progress of our group members and the time we have left before presenting the project. As for texting in the group chat, everyone will be keeping each other up to date with their progress daily to keep track and tackle the situation right away if there are any surprise problems that pop up. Aside from meeting each other online, after lectures and during tutorials we can also discuss the current state of the project on campus. If there are any situations that prevent one of the group members from the weekly group meeting such as problems in their local area, each members are responsible for informing the rest of the group members about it, we would always ask the members about their free time to come up with a meeting period that everyone’s able to participate so the probability of someone not attending the meeting will not be high. And if there are decisions that have to be made during the meeting and one of the members are not present, the rest of the group will have to decide for them and inform them on the group chat, and will further assist them if there is something that they do not understand. We put a lot of effort into each of our meetings to provide enough information so that each member will have more time to focus on their work.

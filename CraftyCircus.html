            Tran Nguyen Anh Khoa <br> ID: S3863956 <br> <br> Born and raised in a tranquill city, Dalat, I don't usually lose my temper. I could stay calm and cool-headed in most situations and do not really pay attention on what people think of me.
            However, I am always a curious boy, I often fantasize about living in a sci-fi worlds and visual worlds. I love watching movies of the fantasy future and hold the desire of creating my own imaginary world where people enjoy. I have a
            great enthusiasm and interest in space and cartoon, for that, I am extremely into sci-fi tales from movies or books. Additionally, I consider myself a crafty person, as a child, I made dragons, soliders out of paper because it fulfilled
            my desire. However, papercrafting seems a bit off for a 18 years old boy so I changed to game development. To be honest, I love making video games, when I first started it with unity I realised what my purpose is. I have over twenty
            projects, though the majority of them is abandoned, I completed some. Then I received many compliments of the games but I have not consider it a success. Therefore, I will still follow this path to the end.

        In Assignment 2, there was a huge procrastination in our group for the few first week, teammates did not complete the content on time. This resulted in extremely exhausting work for the time before deadline. Though we were able to finish the
        assignment on
        time, however, we do not want to spend an enormous burst of energy in a short time. Therefore, we came up with a plan of having punishment for late individual work. We believe members in Crafty Circus will be more responsible in this

              Our first project is going to be a game. Our team will create a game to let maximum 4 people to join and have fun while they are playing with each other. Those four players will play online, thus, many people in the world can have a
              chance to play together. In the game, our team will create many maps in order to let the players choose whatever they want to play with their friends or they can choose it randomly. However, there will also be a story mode for those who
              want to play games with a little plot. In the game, there will be many kinds of enemies going on the path to destroy your place. The players are supposed to put their weapons in some place to destroy the enemies, these weapons are able
              to change the position later.
            </p><br>
            <br>
            <p>Since our team came up with an idea that we would make our first game. We hope that people who spend time playing our game will have lots of different kinds of feelings, which are fun, angry, hopeful, hopeless, etc…. Because we want
              the players to spend time challenging themselves to get the game finished with many different strategies and get high scores. We hope that people who play this game will be able to make friends even they can not have a chance to meet
              each other.

        We want to create an environment for everyone to have a chance to connect. That is the reason why we believe that The Game will be interesting enough for everyone. Moreover, nowadays, everyone tends to play games online and play with friends more than games offline and play alone. Moreover, we create this game for everyone which means streamers also can play it, meaning that we can help them to find a new game to interact with viewers. Fortunately, if we are able to make this project, we are able to show new members, if we recruit, which we can motivate them that we can make a new one like this in the future and we also can develop this game in 3D to attract more players.

        In the market, there are a lot of games which are similar to The Game, for example Tower Defense King, Tower Defence Fantasy, Tower Defense Zone. These games are played by using the game's currency to buy weapons and place them on the way. Those games are extremely addictive because more than 5 million downloads for each, they also have the rate over 4 stars. However, those three are differently compared to our project, The Game. Because our game is supposed to be played by a group of four people to win the game. Moreover, the weapons in our game are allowed to bring it to another place. We also have maps to be chosen to play randomly to interest players in any map they want. That is the biggest difference between ours and others. In case that players who play our game do not have partners, they are able to play the story mode or play with bots.

            <h1>AIM & GOALS</h1>
            <p>
              Our team has decided to make a game as our project because we would like to concentrate on how we bring entertainment to life and create memorable moments for players. Therefore, in order to reach our aim, our team is going to reach as
              small as goals first. We want people to have fun, to investigate and examine the concept we bring. The game will have 6 on 8 features of fun, based on collected game design roads. This includes Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship,
              Discovery and Submission. The way players control mythical heroes or explore unknown place is undoable in real life and here is where the game is fun. It is due to the fact that they will experience things they never had before.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              First of all, our game focuses on helping people to connect. This means that everyone is able to download it and play it together while they are hanging out or even they can have fun while they are staying at home. Since The Game is
              able to play online and allow maximum 4 people to play, every player can make friends worldwide. Especially to local-area players, when friends, brothers, family play with each other, they are developing their relationship.

              <br>The Game would like to force everyone to always come up with new ideas in order to pass the game. Particularly, each map of the game will not be hard but more challenging for players. In order to let the players feel they are
              smarter and more satisfied as soon as they have strategies that work. In this way they are able to compare with our team who has already finished the map before to show that there is not a way to make it.
              <br>Another goal we wanted to have in the game is compelling story. It is the story that made characters unique as they should have differentiate background, and appearance. This would add to the overall enjoyment of the game as players
              may feel connected to their loved characters.
              <br>At the start of every match, players begin with few supply and they will have to get income from low-level minions which sounds a bit boring. However, in reality, low-level farming is not mundane at all, many players enjoy
              destroying and feeling unstoppable which weak minions is suitable.

      <p>Web designers generally have nothing to do with creating content for their projects. Even so, the look of a site can be incomplete if no words are included. Web designers need to find ways to incorporate copyright-free content into their
        designs to provide clients with a look that is as finished as possible.


        Creating a prototype website that also contains copy and images is the only way to help the client understand what the concept behind your design is. Without these elements, the finished product can look quite odd, and the client won’t be
        able to mentally project his own content uploaded on the site.

        Not all people can afford to pay for content immediately after creating their website, so that’s not a condition you can demand from your clients. Instead, you can use a dummy text generator. These generators will give you bits of text that
        are supposed to fill the blank spaces on the website that you are designing.

        Using these text generators is very convenient, as you can set exactly how many paragraphs you need to fit your mock-up. These tools come in handy for any web designer out there. Keep reading more about this topic in this article created by
        our team at Amelia and learn about dummy text generators and where to find the best ones.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Dummy text refers to the bits of content that are used to fill a website mock-up. This text helps web designers better envision how the website will look as a finished product. It is important to understand that dummy text has no meaning
        whatsoever. Its sole purpose is to fill out blank spaces with “word-like” content, without making any copyright infringements.

        Dummy text is also known as filler text or placeholder text, and it has been used for a long time in the various fields of online publishing.

        What purpose does dummy text have?
        Now you know what dummy text is, let’s learn about its usefulness. Some people say that they don’t need to use a dummy text generator to deliver a web design project to the customer. Even though this might be true, the effect that the final
        project will produce on the client won’t be as satisfactory as in the case of one with included filler content.

        A dummy text generator gives web designers the content they need. Then, they can use the typefaces and layout they prefer, thus obtaining the best mock-up of their work. It would be best to be impossible to understand and read because people
        might get distracted by the text itself and its nonsense rather than analyzing how the typefaces integrate into the design instead.

        Dummy text shouldn’t make any logical sense, to keep people from focusing on it instead of the visual impact it has. Using filler text is all about facilitating the visual impression of a final piece of web design.

        Picking a dummy text generator
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place. When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random Paragraph Generator with you in
        mind. The process is quite simple. Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button. Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear.

        While it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people use this generator are listed in the following paragraphs.

        Creative Writing
        Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use
        creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The
        third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.

        Tackle Writers' Block
        A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph
        from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the first place.

        Beginning Writing Routine
        Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing
        started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.</p>

      At the beginning of the project idea, the game was inspired from a smaller video game from Game Jam. To be clear, Game Jam is a contest where participants create games from scratch within a small period of time. This means that we have already
      considered the feasibility of the making as we did not take a serious project. However, it is not without any consideration, according to our plan, this tower defense game would be available to both multiplayer mode and single player mode. As
      our research shows, Unity would support an online server with upto 20 players. This led us to some hesitations, also a limitation, that the game will not support online-player mode at first. As a result, our scope was to create a game that only
      enables multiplayers in local areas when their devices are connected. This will allow us to investigate further to see if the game would receive much attention or not and from this foundation, the game could jump into an online server or not.
      <br> <br>
      Unity Pro is also expensive for our group. Though it is mostly acceptable as we have no need for the Pro version, we are not happy to have Unity logo on startup of the game. Therefore, we mark this as another disadvantage.
      <br> <br>
      Another issue bothering us is level design, as we mentioned earlier in the description, the game heavily relies on collaboration. This develops some restrictions in level design, because we can reuse maps for single player for multiplayers.
      Eventually, this could be a huge limitation that we may not provide a good diversity for the game. The way we could look deeper into the solution may be to allow players to build maps and with high ratings, we could buy the map with reward for
      those players. This scope may be problematic, we think players may abuse this method to get reward.

          There are both free license and professtional one for this program. Unity is a video game engine, we would use Unity to build the game and design maps. Khoa has experienced this program before and he has a few video games made out of this
          program. He is familiar with making 2D games.
          <br><br>
          We will also add some external package to Unity:
          <br>
          <br>
          Monetization package: This is an additional package which we will add to the game later for income.
          <br>
          2D Animation package & PSD Importer package: we will use animation package for real animation while psd imported enables Unity to read photoshop files.

        Our project is to create a game and our team would like to make sure that it will absolutely be played with the least errors possible, therefore, it is compulsory to get The Game tested frequently until it is finished and run smoothly.
        Particularly, we are going to test the gameplay if it crashes while playing before adding graphics, characters, animations and music. Then, the animations need to be accurate and consistent. Our project needs to have a demo firstly for users
        who will give us feedback if there are any mistakes or gibberish. Users are those who have intermediate knowledge about each part of our game because they can help to improve our game to be better. Moreover, users can be a group of people
        whom we randomly choose in RMIT. Although they will not look at details like the intermediate ones, they will have recognized what is wrong happening to our game and if they understand the content of our game or not. Furthermore, they give us
        their feelings about The Game and what they would like to have in the game as a player. Therefore, the intermediate ones can be lecturers in the school and the “player” one that we can ask some random students in the school to play the demo.
        Our expectation is around 20 testers, half IT-professional and half not.

    <h1>RISK</h1>
    <p>Since our group focuses towards making a phone game and more than half of our members have not made any game before, elements like getting used to using the supporting software will be the most difficult challenge. Tools like Unity, Visual Studio, Spine, 2D Animation package, etc… None of the group members has experienced using them before, and we do not know how difficult they are to handle and to be able to maximize the features that are given to us, this is by far one of the major risks that our group will be encountering . Aside from tool difficulties, coding will also be taking part to the project’s uncertainties, there are specific coding languages that programming games would preferred to be working with and that means our group member have to learn to code using that language, that would potentially lead to a huge amount of time loss from getting to know the language and trying to figuring out how to solve the code errors

        Group Processes & Communication
        <p>We are on a quest, check this out for a look into our work and occured events</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="SingleContent">
      The group members are aware that being able to communicate with each other during our time working together takes a very big role in order to produce our desired results. And by taking a look at each members’ location we have determined that the best way to correspond to each group member would be through texting in a group chat and calling through an online chat app called Discord. The meeting will be hosted twice a week during our working time, occasionally there will be three or more based on the progress of our group members and the time we have left before presenting the project. As for texting in the group chat, everyone will be keeping each other up to date with their progress daily to keep track and tackle the situation right away if there are any surprise problems that pop up. Aside from meeting each other online, after lectures and during tutorials we can also discuss the current state of the project on campus. If there are any situations that prevent one of the group members from the weekly group meeting such as problems in their local area, each members are responsible for informing the rest of the group members about it, we would always ask the members about their free time to come up with a meeting period that everyone’s able to participate so the probability of someone not attending the meeting will not be high. And if there are decisions that have to be made during the meeting and one of the members are not present, the rest of the group will have to decide for them and inform them on the group chat, and will further assist them if there is something that they do not understand. We put a lot of effort into each of our meetings to provide enough information so that each member will have more time to focus on their work.

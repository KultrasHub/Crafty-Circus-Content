        <p>At the heart of every myth there lies a kernel of truth, and the truth of the Crafty Circus is one far different than the fiction. It is the creation of four students, with the shared hope and target of getting HDs.</p>

            Tran Nguyen Anh Khoa <br> ID: S3863956 <br> <br> Born and raised in a tranquill city, Dalat, I don't usually lose my temper. I could stay calm and cool-headed in most situations and do not really pay attention on what people think of me. However, I am always a curious boy, I often fantasize about living in a sci-fi worlds and visual worlds. I love watching movies of the fantasy future and hold the desire of creating my own imaginary world where people enjoy. I have a great enthusiasm and interest in space and cartoon, for that, I am extremely into sci-fi tales from movies or books. Additionally, I consider myself a crafty person, as a child, I made dragons, soliders out of paper because it fulfilled my desire. However, papercrafting seems a bit off for a 18 years old boy so I changed to game development. To be honest, I love making video games, when I first started it with unity I realised what my purpose is. I have over twenty projects, though the majority of them is abandoned, I completed some. Then I received many compliments of the games but I have not consider it a success. Therefore, I will still follow this path to the end.

career plan

My ideal job is about to become a game developer which is a programming position. My ideal job is similar to Khoa which is also a game developer. However, Khoa is fond of a design position. Design and programming are completely different, design is harder than programming in my opinion. Because it needs to be creative and attractive to attract players
Comparing to Kent, we are both developers but these two jobs develop in different areas in the IT industry and the work is totally different. Mostly, full-stack is the one working with full web which is the face of the web and manages to let it work completely. That means he will know a little bit about designing the web to attract users.
Lastly, comparing my ideal’s job with Phong’s ideal job, mine is about creating, maintaining and developing source code meanwhile, Phong’s is supposed to analyze and satisfy the request from clients. Specifically, Phong’s job is the “bridge” between clients and employers in order to guarantee that the product and client’s requirements are suitable.

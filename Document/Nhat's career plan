career plan

My ideal job is about to become a game developer which is a programming position. My ideal job is similar to Khoa which is also a game developer. However, Khoa is fond of a design position while developing a game. Design and programming are completely different, design is harder than programming in my opinion. Because it needs to be creative and attractive, which is the face of the product, in this case, it is the face of our game. Besides, programming is solving and connecting everything inside the product to let the product run as smoothly as possible. Although ours is different, it helps each other to get the product finished.

Comparing my ideal job with Khang's ideal job which is programmer and full-stack developer. It is both developers but these two jobs develop in different areas in the IT industry and the work is totally different. As far as I have known, Khang becomes a full-stack developer which means he is able to design and also code. Mostly, full-stack is the one working with full web which is the face of the web and manages to let it work completely. That means he will know a little bit about designing the web to attract users. Although programming and full-stack are absolutely different, we also are able to help each other by the code that we know and the solution. It can be a different language between web development and application development but it is still having the same in thinking and problem solving. 

Lastly, comparing my ideal’s job with Phong’s ideal job, mine is about creating, maintaining and developing source code meanwhile, Phong’s is supposed to analyze and satisfy the request from clients. Specifically, Phong’s job is the “bridge” between clients and employers in order to guarantee that the product and client’s requirements are suitable. That is why Phong is the person who analyzes the lecturer’s requirements and our project to be suitable. Therefore, his ideal job can help mine to understand and make sure that mine is doing the right way.

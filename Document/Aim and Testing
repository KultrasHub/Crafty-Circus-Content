Aim
Aim is the last part of the process while the project is being planned. Our team has decided an aim for our first project which is The Game could be downloaded and played by everyone as soon as it could be done. Specifically, our team would like to have 100 hundred laptops that will download. More or less 400 people could be reached according to The Game played by 4 people in maximum. In order to achieve our aim, there will be 4 more small goals helping The Game reach its aim. First goal is the collaboration with clubs in RMIT for them to have an activity for their meeting. In the second place, a small workshop about how to make a game for RMIT students. Then, raise awareness about our game by introducing it for our friends or SST students in the department and ask them to play together. The last goal is to reveal our game for our lecturer to let him enjoy our game first to get feedback for improvement. 

Firstly, the first goal is the collaboration with other clubs in order to suggest they should use our game as an activity to gather people in the meeting together. It is the best way at the moment because RMIT has lots of clubs and meetings for newbies and official members every semester, The Game could be reached out to more than 100 students at the same time. Estimately, there are 30 to 50 people who join a club’s meeting. 

In the second place, creating a workshop called how to make an individual game for beginners which is a good idea. Because SST has not had one yet for those who like to be a game developer. However, students who study IT would like to create a game by themselves. This workshop will have more or less 30 to 50 students join if the Guest Speaker and our demo are attractive.

The third decision means that our team is going to ask our friends to play with us to let them know about our game and put it on social media in order to spread it out for everyone. Not only our friends, The Game could be played by SST students in the department if we ask them for our first customer. This goal is able to let The Game reach many people but not still not many even if we separate four of us. 

The last one is that The Game will be played for our lecturers to enjoy it. Because there will not be one lecture, therefore we could have a lot of feedback from many lecturers from the departments. If our team is fortunate, the lecturer will like it and have it as an example for next semester. This is also the way that we can reach our game to many people and this way, we also can have credits from new students because it is shown by the lecturers. 

In the case that all the goals and aims will not go well, our team has made a decision that we would go through only the small goal in the order from the fourth to the first one. Because the first one is the most reachable and the hardest one. Therefore, the last one is the easiest one that we hope we are able to make. 

Testing
Our project is to create a game and our team would like to make sure that it will absolutely be played without any bugs, therefore, it is compulsory to get The Game tested every frequently until it is finished and run smoothly. Particularly, we are going to test the gameplay if it crashes while playing before adding graphics, characters, animations and music. Then, the animations need to be accurate and consistent.

Our project needs to have a demo firstly for users who will give us feedback if there are any mistakes or gibberish. Users are those who have intermediate knowledge about each part of our game because they can help to improve our game to be better. Moreover, users can be a group of people whom we randomly choose in RMIT. Although they will not look at details like the intermediate ones, they will have recognized what is wrong happening to our game and if they understand the content of our game or not.

Furthermore, they give us their feelings about The Game and what they would like to have in the game as a player. Therefore, the intermediate ones can be lecturers in the school and the “player” one that we can ask some random students in the school to play the demo.

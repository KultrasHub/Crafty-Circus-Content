CareerPlan and comparison


My ideal job was to be a software engineer and throughout working in assignment 1 and 2, my choice remains the same at this present. As for my career plans at first I specifically wanted to work as an employee for a well-known company that has software programming as one of their working branches such as LG. But the more I get to work in a simulated I.T environment the more I prefer to be working as a freelancer, being a freelancer means I get to work with a more flexible environment and encounter a broader kinds of work without sticking to one genre. Khoa’s career plan for the future is self-employment in the gaming industry. The most similar thing from my career plan and Khoa’s is probably the self-employment element, since being a freelancer that technically means I too am working for myself, the difference is his career plan sticks onto the gaming category while I can choose any request types that I prefer. Nhat and Khang’s career plan difference comparing to mine is also similar to Khoa, Nhat will be working under a company as a game developer while Khang already has a company that he will be working for as soon as he finishes his studies, Khang also wishes to progress further from his future company by being open to other job offerings, ultimately the biggest aspects that differentiates between my career plans and Khang, Nhat’s is that they have a certain path to follow and the preference of working under a certain category with a steady salary while I look for requests with different amounts of payment under various working topics.

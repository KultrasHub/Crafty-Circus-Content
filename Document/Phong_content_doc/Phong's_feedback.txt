Phong's personal feedback:

At this moment after almost ten weeks working together as a group through project two and three I have finally gotten a wider understanding and the strengths, limitations of each member of the group. Before talking about other members, judging from my own personal performance in the assignment three, I can finally confidently say that my time management on working and completing my part as well as helping other group mates with their tasks has improved a lot compared to the last assignment that we did. I managed to deliver my necessary information about the assignment that the group needed at the ideal time with good quality.

Nhat's:

Nhat has outdone himself with his section providing extremely detailed descriptions and works. Not only that but he also stood up and took one of the questions that demanded a high amount of accuracy, actively participating with the group work and providing his assistance after he finished his part. Overall I would say that he has proven himself with his huge contribution on this assignment.

Khoa's:

Khoa still remains the strongest member of the group as he mostly take part in making the website again while completing his assigned sections, additionally one of the challenges that he has to take is showing the rest of the member how to design and partially demonstrate on how to use the project-related applications which was double the amount of work that other members have to do, yet he still manages to make it on time of the assigned due date, I am very glad that I got to work with him throughout our group assignment.

Khang's:

Khang has shown me a lot of his focus towards the assignment throughout the working period. Because all of my courses I share with Khang while I was studying with him, the one thing that he keeps mentioning is the questions he has on his section which reflects back on how much he cares for this assignments and how he wants to perfect his section so that the group can have a well-informed product.

Feedback

Some feedbacks on the members, according to my perspective, are as follows. In general, the members have completed the assigned work very seriously and followed the set schedule without delay and completed very evenly. The communication between the members is also better. About Kultras, the code has completed a very good job, even helping other members when having trouble. Although the individual time is very busy for Nhật, he still completes all assigned tasks, but Nhật still missed group meetings and the least communication to overcome and arrange the time. Phong in Assignment 3 is the member who worries about the content the most and still completes it well. As for myself, I feel that I have not done very well when I do wrong some assigned tasks, but I still try to fix and complete it within the time set, and I need to fix this rare problem.

Career Plan

My ideal job is a Full-stack. And it is a lot different from the other team member’s career. My type of job is professional in web design and programming. I have the ambition to assemble my team to undertake many big and small projects and start-up my reputation in IT by working in a company first.

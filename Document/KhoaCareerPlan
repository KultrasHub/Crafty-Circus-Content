I have a dream of working in the game industry. Although I have an ideal job, Game Designer, I am ambitious about having my own business. This is quite different from other members in the team.

I and Nhat will be working in the same industry, however, his plan is more likely to get employed. Therefore, there is a connection between our plans.

On the other hand, Phong wants more freedom at work so he chose to be a freelancer. In contrast, my work would be more reliable than his, as he only can earn money when he is hired. The pattern of work is also distinct.

Kent and I may share the same ideas, is to establish a team. However, he is less relentless than me as he wants to gain experience from working first.

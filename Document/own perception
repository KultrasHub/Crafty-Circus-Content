In my own perception, each member in the group is responsible and gets their tasks done as soon as possible even though there was sometimes that each of us was busy. We read each other's tasks to improve and make sure that we are doing right, this is the best thing while we are doing in that group because it shows how responsible we are for the assignment, not only the single task we have been given. One thing that I think we are doing better than the previous assignment is that we are getting used to using Github. Due to the number of commits in Github, We are now using Github frequently, we do not wait until we have the task done and then commit at the end. This is the good thing that we are now able to keep track of everyone's tasks guaranteedly, because it has evidence which is more reliable than just reporting by talking. Surprisingly, this assignment has not had a long deadline, it is more or less short, however, our team is able to manage and get it done sooner than the previous one. This is a good point while we are in a team which shows how improved we are.

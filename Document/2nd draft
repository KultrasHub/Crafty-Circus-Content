Aim and goal

Our team has decided to make a game as our project because we would like to concentrate on how we bring entertainment in life and create memorable moments for players. Therefore, in order to reach our aim, our team is going to reach as small as goals first. Firstly, we want our game to be a way that people, even strangers, can have a chance to talk and to get to know each other as well as they have already played the game. Secondly, our team wants to let all the players come up with many strategies to pass the game. 

First of all, our game focuses on helping people to connect everyone. Meaning that everyone is able to download it and play it together while they are hanging out or even they can have fun while they are staying at home. Since The Game is able to play online and allow maximum 4 people to play, every player can make friends worldwide. 

The Game would like to force everyone to always come up with new ideas in order to pass the game. Particularly, each map of the game will not be hard but more challenging for players. In order to let the players feel they are smarter and more satisfied as soon as they pass the game. In this way they are able to compare with our team who has already finished the map before to show that there is not a way to make it.
